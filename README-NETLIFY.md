# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Netlify Deployment

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Zip the `build` folder
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag the zip file to deploy

### Option 2: Git Integration
1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Netlify build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Connect to Netlify:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Build settings:
     - **Publish directory**: `build`
     - **Build command**: (leave empty)

## Important Limitations

⚠️ **This is a DEMO version only** - Netlify hosts static sites, so:

- ❌ **No camera access** (requires Python backend)
- ❌ **No face recognition** (requires OpenCV/dlib)
- ❌ **No attendance saving** (requires server)
- ✅ **UI demonstration** works perfectly
- ✅ **Shows system design** and features

## For Full Functionality

Deploy the complete Python application on:

### Railway (Recommended)
- Free tier available
- Automatic HTTPS
- Easy Python deployment
- Fixed requirements.txt included

### Render
- Free tier available  
- Good for Python apps
- Automatic deployments

### Heroku
- Requires credit card
- Reliable platform
- Easy scaling

## Files Structure

```
build/
├── index.html          # Static demo page
└── (assets if needed)

netlify.toml           # Netlify configuration
README-NETLIFY.md      # This guide
```

## Demo Features

The Netlify demo includes:
- ✅ Complete UI design
- ✅ Interactive buttons (demo mode)
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Bootstrap styling
- ✅ Sample data display
- ✅ Links to deploy full version

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy demo on Netlify** (for UI showcase)
2. **Deploy full app on Railway** (for actual use)
3. **Share both links** - demo for preview, Railway for functionality
